## SILVA: A Scalable Incremental Layered Sparse Value-Flow Analysis

SILVA is an incremental layered sparse value-flow analysis that scales to large, real-world programs efficiently. 

## Get Started
### Prerequisites
LLVM 14.0.0

### Set Up

```
# sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ libtinfo5 libz-dev libzstd-dev zip wget libncurses5-dev ##(If running on Ubuntu 20.04)

# git clone https://github.com/Patrickstarrrrr/SILVA.git
# cd SILVA
# source ./build.sh
```

### Run

To perform incremental analysis, you need to provide two directories containing the source code of the program before and after modifications (beforeDir & afterDir), as well as the two versions of the binary code files compiled from the source code (before.bc & after.bc).

Run the following command to perform incremental pointer analysis：
```
# wpa \
    -sourcediff=path/to/source/diff/file \
    -beforecpp=path/to/old/version/dir \
    -aftercpp=path/to/new/version/dir \
    -iander \
    -is-new=true \
    -irdiff \
    -relapath=true \
    path/to/new/version/bc/file/newVersion.bc >
```

Run the following command to perform incremental value-flow analysis：
```
# wpa \
    -sourcediff=path/to/source/diff/file \
    -beforecpp=path/to/old/version/dir \
    -aftercpp=path/to/new/version/dir \
    -iander \
    -svfg
    -is-new=true \
    -irdiff \
    -relapath=true \
    path/to/new/version/bc/file/newVersion.bc
```

## Example
The directory structure for the ```example``` directory is as follows:
```
example
├── newBc
│   └── example.bc
├── newDir
│   └── example.cpp
├── oldBc
│   └── example.bc
├── oldDir
    └── example.cpp


```

This structure includes folders for new and old versions of the binary files (newBc and oldBc) and the source code (newDir and oldDir).
To run incremental value-flow analysis, use the following command:
```
# cd SILVA/example
# wpa \
    -sourcediff=./sourceDiff.txt \
    -beforecpp=./oldDir \
    -aftercpp=./newDir \
    -iander \
    -svfg
    -is-new=true \
    -irdiff \
    -relapath=true \
    ./newBc/example.bc
```
